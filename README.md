# To-Do Application with Django and React

React serves as the frontend, or client-side framework, handling the user interface and getting and setting data via requests to the Django backend, which is an API built using the Django REST framework.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Django, Django REST framework
- **Frontend**: React, Axios
- **Database**: SQLite (default)

## Upcoming DevOps and TDD Integrations

To enhance this project and improve my DevOps skills, I will be working on the following integrations:

### Version Control & Continuous Integration (CI) with TDD

1. **Version Control System (VCS)**
   - Initialize a Git repository for the project.
   - Use branching strategies like GitFlow or GitHub Flow.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**
   - Set up CI pipelines using GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Travis CI.
   - Implement automated testing:
     - **Backend (Django)**: Use `pytest` and `pytest-django` for testing.
     - **Frontend (React)**: Use `Jest` and `React Testing Library` for testing.

3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
   - Write tests before code (Red-Green-Refactor cycle):
     - **Backend**: Create tests for models and views.
     - **Frontend**: Create tests for components and interactions.

### Continuous Deployment (CD) & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

4. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
   - Set up CD pipelines for automated deployments to staging or production environments.

5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Use Terraform to describe and provision infrastructure (servers, databases, networks).

### Configuration Management & Containerization

6. **Configuration Management**
   - Use Ansible to automate installation and configuration of the application and associated services.

7. **Containerization**
   - Dockerize the frontend and backend applications.
   - Use Docker Compose to orchestrate the application's containers.

### Orchestration & Monitoring

8. **Orchestration**
   - Deploy and manage containers at scale with Kubernetes.

9. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Set up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring application performance and health.
   - Implement logging using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

### Security

10. **Security**
    - Integrate security tools like OWASP and Snyk to analyze code and dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    - Implement security policies to protect the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure.

## Example of CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

Below is an example configuration for a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:latest
        ports:
          - 5432:5432
        env:
          POSTGRES_DB: test_db
          POSTGRES_USER: user
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run Django tests
        run: python manage.py test

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install Node.js dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run React tests
        run: npm test -- --watchAll=false

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: |
          # Commandes pour déployer votre application
          echo "Déploiement en cours..."
